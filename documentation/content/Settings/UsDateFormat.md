title: UsDateFormat
---

The UsDateFormat setting is used to define the date format that will be used when creating checking for [[AtAnnotation | AtAnnotations]]. You an switch between the US and the DE date format.
The US date format is `MM/DD/YYYY` and the DE date format is `DD/MM/YYYY`.

> When switching into the DE format the [Chrono](https://github.com/wanasit/chrono) library will switch into german mode and will only detect german dates as well as words.
