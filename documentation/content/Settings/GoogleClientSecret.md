title: Google Client Secret
---

This setting is required when using a private Google Cloud Project.
This is indicated by switching the [[UseCustomClient]] setting to `true`.
If you don't have a private Google Cloud Project go to the [[Setup]] guide.
The client Secret will be used to authenticate with Google and is required to use the plugin.
Make sure to keep it secret.
