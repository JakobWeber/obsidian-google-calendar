title: Use Custom Client
---

This setting indicates whether a custom Google Cloud Project is used to authenticate with Google.

Currently the only option to use the plugin is to use a private Google Cloud Project.
In the future a public Google Cloud Project could be provided to allow users to use the plugin without creating their own project.
This should help to reduce the barrier of entry for new users, but is currently WIP.

If you don't have a private Google Cloud Project go to the [[Setup]] guide.
