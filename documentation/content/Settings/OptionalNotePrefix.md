title: Optional Note Prefix
---

The Optional Note Prefix is a string that can be defined in the settings and later by used in the [[EventNoteNameFormat]] to add a prefix to the name of an [[EventNote]].

This option is not recommended and may be removed in the future. It is recommended to enter the string directly into the [[EventNoteNameFormat]].
