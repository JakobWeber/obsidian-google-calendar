title: Refresh Interval
---

The refresh interval defines how often the plugin will check for changes in your google calendar.
If you are using a [[UseCustomClient | CustomClient]] you can set this value to 10 seconds.
If you are using the public client you can set this value to 1 minute. This is because the public client has a limited amount of requests per day.
I recommend to set this value to 1 minute for both clients.
This wil reduce the amount of request to Google.
