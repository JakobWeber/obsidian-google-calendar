title: DebugMode
---

The DebugMode setting is used to enable or disable the debug mode of the plugin.
If this setting is enabled the plugin will log additional information to the console.
This information can be used to debug issues with the plugin.
This is especially useful when you encounter problems with the [[ObsidianGoogleCalendarAPI]] as it will show you the network requests and responses.
Only enable this setting if you are trying to debug an issue with the plugin.
