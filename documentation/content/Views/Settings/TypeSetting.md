title: Type Setting
---

The type setting only works in the [[Codeblocks]] and defines the type of the view to display.
For [[Views]] this setting can not be changed.

The following types are available:

- `day` to display a [[TimelineView]] for a single day
- `week` to display a [[WeekView]]
- `month` to display a [[MonthView]]
- `year` to display a [[YearView]]
- `schedule` to display a [[ScheduleView]]
- `web` to display a [[WebView]]

This setting is an string value and default to `day`
Example:

~~~md
```gEvent
type: schedule
```
~~~
